The solution can also be found at [this jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gregsandell/u9c7074n/).

###Assignment Objective:

To create an algorithm written in JavaScript that replaces the top 25 most common words based on their
frequency with the their count inline. Your code should be pasteable and runnable in the browser console.

###Requirements:

* Page to process and run your code on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language
* A word may not include HTML tags, JavaScript code, numbers, spaces or punctuation.
* A word may notbe from the top 100 common words in english and you may not hardcode these into
the source code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English
* Also please remove common words “are”, “is”, “where”, “was” and any single characters
* You may use JQuery and standard JavaScript but no other third party library
* Your code should be runnable on recent Chrome or Firefox browser.

###Example:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to your html file on disk.
2. The page should update to look like the image below. It is okay if your counts are off by a few.
